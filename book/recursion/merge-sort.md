# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a pretty neat algorithm. It relies upon some exceptionally interesting recursive functions that are at least good to *see* even if you will almost certainly never need to write functions like this in Elm. So read this like a tour of various tricks that expand your expectations, not as exercises that you should find obvious or easy!

Merge sort relies on a couple observations:

  1. A list with one element is sorted.
  2. If you keep splitting a list in half, eventually you will have a bunch of lists with one element.
  3. If you have two sorted lists, merging them into a single sorted list is easy.

That last claim seems kind of dubious. Is it actually easy to merge two sorted lists? Let’s start there.


## Merge

First, check out this animation of how we want to merge two sorted lists:

![merge](merge.gif)

In both lists, the smallest element is the first element. We look at both of those and pick the smallest overall. That becomes the smallest element in our resulting list. We can then repeat this process until we ended up with a merged list. But how do we write the code to do this?!

On the previous page of this book, we said that one strategy for writing recursive functions is to (1) use `case` and (2) pretend you done. Let’s try that route:

```elm
merge : List comparable -> List comparable -> List comparable
merge listOne listTwo =
  case (listOne, listTwo) of
    ([], []) ->
      ...

    (front :: rest, []) ->
      ...

    ([], front :: rest) ->
      ...

    (frontOne :: restOne, frontTwo :: restTwo) ->
      ...
```

The first case is the easiest. If both lists are empty, merging them will result in an empty list. The second and third cases are pretty similar. If one lists is empty, merging will result in the *other* list.

```elm
merge : List comparable -> List comparable -> List comparable
merge listOne listTwo =
  case (listOne, listTwo) of
    ([], []) ->
      []

    (_ :: _, []) ->
      listOne

    ([], _ :: _) ->
      listTwo

    (frontOne :: restOne, frontTwo :: restTwo) ->
      ...
```

At this point, the three patterns we have implemented kind of overlap in how they work. We can shuffle them around to look like this:

```elm
merge : List comparable -> List comparable -> List comparable
merge listOne listTwo =
  case (listOne, listTwo) of
    (_, []) ->
      listOne

    ([], _) ->
      listTwo

    (frontOne :: restOne, frontTwo :: restTwo) ->
      ...
```

If a list is empty, return the other one. If they are both empty, it will match the first pattern and return `listOne` which is an empty list! This trick is definitely not necessary, but I hope it is valuable to see.

We are losing focus here. What about that last branch? Well, we know `listOne` and `listTwo` are sorted, so it must be true that either `frontOne` or `frontTwo` is the lowest value overall. We can check for that:

```elm
merge : List comparable -> List comparable -> List comparable
merge listOne listTwo =
  case (listOne, listTwo) of
    (_, []) ->
      listOne

    ([], _) ->
      listTwo

    (frontOne :: restOne, frontTwo :: restTwo) ->
      if frontOne < frontTwo then
        frontOne :: ...
      else
        frontTwo :: ...
```

Now it is time for step two of writing a recursive function. **Pretend you are done.** Wouldn’t it be great if we had a function that could `merge` all the remaining values? Let’s pretend!

```elm
merge : List comparable -> List comparable -> List comparable
merge listOne listTwo =
  case (listOne, listTwo) of
    (_, []) ->
      listOne

    ([], _) ->
      listTwo

    (frontOne :: restOne, frontTwo :: restTwo) ->
      if frontOne < frontTwo then
        frontOne :: merge restOne listTwo
      else
        frontTwo :: merge listOne restTwo
```

We take the lowest value off of one of the lists, and then call `merge` on the leftovers. Now that we have a `merge` function that can combine two sorted lists, but how do we *get* those two lists?


## Split

We need some `split` function that can take a list and split it in half into two lists.

```elm
split : List a -> ( List a, List a )
split list =
  ...
```

Now our trusty two step process says to start with a `case` expression:

```elm
split : List a -> ( List a, List a )
split list =
  case list of
    [] ->
      ...

    front :: rest ->
      ...
```

If we have an empty list, when we split it into two, we will get *two* empty lists.

```elm
split : List a -> ( List a, List a )
split list =
  case list of
    [] ->
      ( [], [] )

    front :: rest ->
      ...
```

At this point it is kind of unclear how to proceed. We need to put `front` somewhere, but which list should we put it on? I do not really know. Time to try out our second strategy for writing recursive functions: create a helper function that keeps track of extra information. In this case, it would be nice to build up the two half lists as we go along.

```elm
split : List a -> ( List a, List a )
split list =
  splitHelp list [] []

splitHelp : List a -> List a -> List a -> ( List a, List a )
splitHelp list halfOne halfTwo =
  case list of
    [] ->
      (halfOne, halfTwo)

    first :: rest ->
      ...
```

In the second case, we have the `first` value of `list`, but should we put it on `halfOne` or `halfTwo`? We cannot put `front` on `halfOne` every time or in the end `halfTwo` will still be empty! It feels like we need more information... Well, with the helper function strategy, whenever we feel like we need more info, we can just add it as an argument. So let’s start keeping track of a `Bool` that determines which list we should be adding to:

```elm
split : List a -> ( List a, List a )
split list =
  splitHelp list True [] []

splitHelp : List a -> Bool -> List a -> List a -> ( List a, List a )
splitHelp list addToHalfOne halfOne halfTwo =
  case list of
    [] ->
      (halfOne, halfTwo)

    first :: rest ->
      if addToHalfOne then
        splitHelp rest (not addToHalfOne) (first :: halfOne) halfTwo
      else
        splitHelp rest (not addToHalfOne) halfOne (first :: halfTwo)
```

Now as we go through, the `addToHalfOne` value keeps switching between `True` and `False` so we end up splitting every other element into separate lists.

> **Note:** There are tons of other ways to implement `split` that can be fun and educational to explore. For example, having an `Int` that increments as you go through and adding to one list or the other depending on whether it is odd or even. There are two implementations that are particularly interesting though, and I wrote about them [here](../appendix/split.md). These implementations do not really teach you practical skills, but they are definitely worth checking out!


## Sort

Now that we have `split` and `merge`, it is time to finally write our `sort` function. We start like normal, by using `case` to break things up.

```elm
sort : List comparable -> List comparable
sort list =
  case list of
    [] ->
      []

    first :: rest ->
      ...
```

To take the next step, let’s take another look at the crucial observations that make merge sort work:

  1. A list with one element is sorted.
  2. If you keep splitting a list in half, eventually you will have a bunch of lists with one element.
  3. If you have two sorted lists, merging them into a single sorted list is easy.

Okay, so a list with zero elements is sorted. A list with one element is sorted. Let’s fill in those facts.

```elm
sort : List comparable -> List comparable
sort list =
  case list of
    [] ->
      list

    [_] ->
      list

    _ ->
      ...
```

In the last case, we know we have two or more elements. Let’s just start using the functions we have available and see what happens:

```elm
sort : List comparable -> List comparable
sort list =
  case list of
    [] ->
      list

    [_] ->
      list

    _ ->
      let
      	(halfOne, halfTwo) =
      	  split list
      in
        ...
```

Okay, we can split the `list` in half. Now is the crucial step. Pretend you are done. We know that merging two sorted lists results in a sorted list, so wouldn’t it be wonderful if there was some way to sort `halfOne` and `halfTwo`?

```elm
sort : List comparable -> List comparable
sort list =
  case list of
    [] ->
      list

    [_] ->
      list

    _ ->
      let
      	(halfOne, halfTwo) =
      	  split list
      in
        merge (sort halfOne) (sort halfTwo)
```

I personally found it kind of hard to believe that this works when I first learned it, so I recommend playing with the code [here](http://elm-lang.org/examples/merge-sort) and trying it out on different lists.

Now again, this outline of merge sort is primarily intended to expose you to some exceptionally interesting recursive functions. This is in no way representative of how difficult it is to write functional programs. These are the gems mined by academics over decades, and I just think it is worth taking a look!
